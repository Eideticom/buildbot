These are instructions for how to install
a new version of buildbot and upgrade the
build-master to run off that installation.
----------------------------------------------

Clone new buildbot code onto target machine.

If the new buildbot matches the version of the buildbot/buildbot repo
Git fetch (buildbot/buildbot repo) --tags
Otherwise add a tag of the format .. git tag v3.0.0 	(v then 3 numbers separated by a decimal)
This number must be larger than all other tags for it to be the output of buildbot --version

This step isn't necessary, but if there are errors it might help
	sudo /opt/anaconda3/bin/pip uninstall buildbot .. and buildbot-worker

In buildbot/master .. 	python setup.py build
			sudo /opt/anaconda3/bin/python setup.py install
In buildbot/worker .. 	python setup.py build
			sudo /opt/anaconda3/bin/python setup.py install

The new version of buildbot is now installed, and buildbot --version will output your new version#

If there are any build masters on this machine that were using the old version, they have to be upgraded
	In build-master
	buildbot stop master .. might have to kill -9 process if it will not stop
	buildbot upgrade-master master
	buildbot start master

Your build-master will now run off the correct installation
